# Discourage me!

A funny plugin for Roblox Studio that discourages you rather than encouraging you.

## Installation

Installation is fairly easy if you happen to know how to use Roblox Studio and Finder/File Explorer. Simply download this [plugin model](https://github.com/va1kio/discourage-me/raw/main/src/Plugin.rbxm)  and drag it into an empty baseplate in Studio, then export the model as a local plugin by right clicking or two fingers tapping while hovering at the model in Explorer.
